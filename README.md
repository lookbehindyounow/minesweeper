# Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game I made in my spare time when I was working as a waiter/bartender before CodeClan. I have plans to make it more modular & readable because in it's current state although it works it's quite messy.

Everything should work out of the box with standard Python3 but on mac the interface is pretty wonky because I made it on my pc & I'm not sure I had a great grasp of Tkinter at the time.
