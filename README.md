# Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game I made in my spare time when I was working as a waiter/bartender before CodeClan. I'm working on making the code less messy & more readable, maybe more efficient too.

Everything's broken atm cause I'm halfway through the changes & I've not managed to tie them all back together yet, but previous versions work well on windows & alright on mac (functions properly but gui is a bit wonky)
